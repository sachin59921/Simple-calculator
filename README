 I have developed a simple calculator using Python language with a graphical user interface (GUI). The calculator has all the basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The GUI has a clean and intuitive design, making it easy for users to input numbers and perform calculations. Additionally, the calculator allows users to clear the input field with a single button click, making it convenient for them to start a new calculation. Overall, this simple calculator is a useful tool for anyone who needs to perform quick calculations without the need for more complex features.
